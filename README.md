# Parsivel2-data-analysis

It is data analysis code for OTT Parsivel². OTT Parsivel² is laser disdrometer for comprehensive measurement of all precipitation types (Rain, snow ....). The data measured by OTT Parsivel² is provided as files in msi format. It is very difficult to analyze raw files in msi format. I've seen this happen before, and I'm sharing the analysis program. If you need any further information, please contact us.
